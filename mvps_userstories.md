Project 2 

Minimum Viable Product (MVPs):

1. When the page loads, the user will see an interactive gameboard, with a “Start” button above it.

2. Under the start button, there will be a field for the user to submit their name; it will be displayed as Player 1 (X).

3. X can click anywhere on the board in the beginning, however, once a square has been selected by either player, they will not be able to click in that square again for the duration of the game.

4. Once clicked, X will remain visible to the user in whichever square it is in. O will also similarly remain visible to the user in the gameboard once the turn switch occurs.

5. Will use classes to help determine the logic for possible wins or ties after different squares are clicked

6. If X wins, there will be an alert to tell them that they won. If O wins, they will similarly receive an alert. If the game is a tie, both users will be told it is a tie.

7. In case of a tie, present them with a button to clear the game board and start again.

User stories:

- When the page loads, the user will see an empty gameboard with a “Start” button above it and a place to enter their name.

- The user will be Player 1, who will be X. There will also be a Player 2, and the turns will switch from X to O.

- If X or O wins, they will be informed of this. If it is a tie, the user can start the game over again.

_________________

Stretch Goals:

- Have an AI randomly select the position for O, in any empty tile that X has not already selected.

- Make it super pretty/eye-catching

Conceptual thoughts and questions:

- Will each Div have to have a unique ID?

- Need to review using switch statements while inside a loop

- Will employ the use of “setTimeOut” to allow for the players to switch
