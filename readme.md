## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two player game where the goal of each user is to mark their turn as an X or an O on a gameboard with three columns and three rows. The first user to get three in a row, either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically will be the winner. In the case of a tie, the users will be asked to play the game again until a clear winner has been declared.

## Motivation

Tic tac toe is a solid game to show front-end capabilities in the browser. We will be storing session-only data in the browser that will reset itself when either of the users start the game over again.

## Stretch Goals

- When the user wins, show a cool transition - create a DIV or change colors, make the win fun for the user to see

- Have an AI randomly select the position for O, in any empty tile that X has not already selected.

- Make the gameboard and page as a whole colorful and eye-catching

## Difficulties

- Project planning and figuring out what sort of JS functions I want to have in my tic tac toe game.

- Understanding JS data structures

- Deducing best practices with JS to make sure that the end user is able to enjoy the game

## Languages

HTML, CSS & JavaScript
